## What is NPM?

**NPM** is a tool for managing JavaScript packages. It helps developers install and update the libraries or tools their projects need. It's widely used with **Node.js**, but can also be used in other JavaScript projects. Here's how it works:

- **Install packages**: NPM helps you get the libraries or tools you need for your project.
- **Manage versions**: NPM helps you control which version of a package your project uses.
- **Share packages**: You can share your own packages with others through the NPM registry.
