## Introduction
This document outlines various GitOps strategies, detailing what they are, why they are important.
GitOps is a powerful approach for managing and deploying applications and infrastructure using Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application configurations 

## What is GitOps Strategies?
Gitops leverages tools to automate deployments, track changes, and ensure system state matches what is described in Git.
It applies Git-based workflows to operations, making Git the central point for system configurations and deployments. 


## Why Implement GitOps Strategies?
| **Principle**           | **Description**                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consistency**         | Ensures that deployments are consistent across different environments by using a single source of truth.         |
| **Automation**          | Reduces manual intervention through automated deployments and synchronization, which improves efficiency.         |
| **Auditability**        | Provides a clear audit trail of changes and deployments, enhancing transparency and traceability.                |
| **Rollback and Recovery** | Facilitates easy rollback to previous states in case of failures or issues, thanks to versioned configurations in Git. |
| **Security**            | Improves security by leveraging Gitâ€™s access controls and providing a clear history of changes.                   |


## Types of GitOps Workflow
GitOps workflows can be categorized based on how they handle configuration and deployment processes. Here are the common types:

### 1. Declarative GitOps
-	Description: Configuration and deployment are defined declaratively in Git repositories. The desired state of the system is described using configuration files (e.g., YAML) stored in Git.
-	How It Works: Changes to configuration files trigger automated deployments to align the actual state with the desired state.
-	Example Tools: Argo CD, Flux.
### 2. Pull-Based GitOps

- Pull-Based GitOps, a GitOps agent (like Argo CD or Flux) runs inside a cluster and continuously monitors Git repository for changes. When it detects a difference between the desired state (in Git) and the actual state (in the cluster), it automatically synchronizes the two by applying changes to the cluster.

-	Example Tools: Argo CD,  Flux  
-	Argo CD: Argo CD constantly polls or uses webhooks to detect changes in the repo.
 
### 3. Push-Based GitOps
-	Description: Changes are pushed to the Git repository, and a webhook or similar mechanism triggers an immediate update to the system.
-	How It Works: The GitOps tool is notified via webhooks or other notifications when changes are made to the Git repository, prompting an immediate deployment.
-	Example Tools: Argo CD (with webhook support).
### 4. Hybrid GitOps
-	Description: Combines elements of both pull-based and push-based GitOps. It may use pull-based synchronization for regular updates and push-based mechanisms for urgent or critical changes.
-	How It Works: Regular synchronization is managed by the pull-based approach, while critical updates can be pushed through notifications or manual triggers.
-	Example Tools: Argo CD (supports both methods), Flux (with additional tooling for push-based triggers).

## Comparison of GitOps Workflows


| **Feature**              | **Declarative GitOps**                  | **Pull-Based GitOps**                    | **Push-Based GitOps**                     | **Hybrid GitOps**                        |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Configuration Definition** | Declarative files in Git                | Declarative files in Git                | Declarative files in Git                 | Declarative files in Git                |
| **Sync Mechanism**       | Automated sync                           | Regular periodic checks                 | Immediate notifications                  | Regular checks + notifications          |
| **Deployment Trigger**   | Changes in Git repository                | Changes in Git repository               | Webhooks or notifications                | Mix of periodic checks and notifications |
| **Tool Examples**        | Argo CD, Flux                            | Flux, Argo CD (with sync)               | Argo CD (with webhooks)                  | Argo CD (with mixed methods)            |
| **Latency**              | Depends on sync interval                 | Periodic updates (variable)             | Immediate                                | Variable, depending on method           |
| **Complexity**           | Moderate                                 | Low to moderate                         | Moderate to high                         | High                                    |


## Conclusion

Implementing GitOps improves deployment efficiency, consistency, and security. Declarative GitOps ensures reliable deployments from config files. Pull-based GitOps syncs regularly from Git, while push-based enables immediate updates. Hybrid GitOps balances both approaches. The best strategy depends on your update needs, environment complexity, and team expertise.
