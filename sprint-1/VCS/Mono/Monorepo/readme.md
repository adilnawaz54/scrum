## Introduction
A **Monorepo** (short for Monolithic Repository) is a software development strategy where all the code for multiple projects, services, or libraries is stored in a single shared repository.

## Why use Mono repo?

- **Simplified Dependency Management**: Shared libraries and components are easily reused without complex versioning.
- **Atomic Changes**: Update multiple projects in one commit, keeping everything in sync.
- **Better Collaboration**: Teams work across services without switching repositories.
- **Improved Visibility**: Everyone sees changes across the system, reducing duplication and misalignment.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| **Easier Code Sharing** | All your projects live together, so sharing libraries or modules between them is easy. |
| **Unified Versioning** | You can update multiple services together, keeping dependencies and APIs in sync. |
| **Simplified Dev Workflow** | Single place to build, test, and deploy everything — reduces setup complexity. |
| **Better Visibility** | Teams can easily see changes across projects, improving collaboration and code quality. |
| **Atomic Changes** | You can make a change across multiple apps in a single commit (e.g., API change + client updates). |
| **Centralized Tooling** | Linting, formatting, testing — all standardized with one configuration. |
| **Scales Well** | With proper tools (like Bazel, Nx, Lerna), even huge repos stay fast and manageable. |

## Advantages of Monorepo

| **Advantage**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simplified Dependency Management** | Easier to maintain and update shared libraries across multiple projects.        |
| **Better Code Reuse**            | Common modules can be reused easily without duplication.                        |
| **Coordinated Changes**           | Changes affecting multiple projects can be made in a single atomic commit.      |
| **Unified CI/CD**                 | Centralized build, test, and deployment pipelines ensure consistency.            |
| **Faster Onboarding**             | New developers can quickly set up and access the entire codebase.               |
| **Consistent Standards**          | Easier to apply and enforce coding, testing, and deployment standards.           |
| **Efficient Refactoring**         | Refactor or upgrade across projects easily without managing multiple repos.      |
| **Single Source of Truth**       | All code, tools, and configurations are kept in one place for easy access.        |

## Disadvantages of Monorepo

| **Disadvantage**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability Challenges**        | Very large codebases can lead to slower builds and require specialized tooling. |
| **Complex Access Control**        | Harder to restrict access to specific parts of the codebase if needed.           |
| **Increased Build Times**         | Changes in one module might trigger builds/tests across unrelated modules.      |
| **Tooling Limitations**           | Some existing tools may not efficiently handle very large repositories.         |
| **Merge Conflicts**               | Higher chance of conflicts when multiple teams work on the same repo.           |
| **Repository Size Management**    | Managing the size of the repository (e.g., history, artifacts) becomes critical.|
| **Harder Rollbacks**              | Mistakes can impact multiple projects at once, making rollbacks tricky.         |
| **Steeper Learning Curve**        | Newcomers may feel overwhelmed by the scale and complexity of a monorepo.        |

## Best Practices for Monorepo Management

| **Best Practices**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Modular Code Structure**  | Organize the codebase in a modular fashion to minimize the complexity and impact of changes on unrelated parts of the system.                                            |
| **Tooling for Scalability** | Use tools like Bazel or Lerna to handle the scalability challenges that arise from large monorepos, such as dependency management, incremental builds, and testing.      |
| **Enforce Code Ownership**  | Implement code ownership policies to ensure that specific teams or individuals are responsible for different parts of the repository.                                    |
| **CI/CD Optimization**      | Optimize your CI/CD pipelines for efficiency. Use incremental builds and selective testing to avoid unnecessary processing for unrelated changes.                        |
| **Clear Documentation**     | Document each module or component thoroughly, so that developers can quickly understand the purpose and scope of various parts of the codebase.                          |
| **Versioning Strategy**     | Consider a versioning strategy that suits your monorepo, such as tagging releases for the entire repository or versioning individual modules independently.               |

## Conclusion
A monorepo offers significant benefits for large teams and organizations that rely on shared codebases and close collaboration between projects. By using best practices such as modularization, scalable tooling, and robust CI/CD pipelines, teams can manage the complexity of monorepos while benefiting from enhanced code reuse, visibility, and consistent deployment processes.
