## Introduction
A **Monorepo** (short for Monolithic Repository) is a software development strategy where all the code for multiple projects, services, or libraries is stored in a single shared repository.

## What is Monolithic Architecture?
Monolithic architecture is a software design methodology that combines all of an application's components into a single, inseparable unit. Under this architecture, the user interface, business logic, and data access layers are all created, put into use, and maintained as one, unified unit.

## Why use Mono repo?

- **Simplified Dependency Management**: Shared libraries and components are easily reused without complex versioning.
- **Atomic Changes**: Update multiple projects in one commit, keeping everything in sync.
- **Better Collaboration**: Teams work across services without switching repositories.
- **Improved Visibility**: Everyone sees changes across the system, reducing duplication and misalignment.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| **Easier Code Sharing** | All your projects live together, so sharing libraries or modules between them is easy. |
| **Unified Versioning** | You can update multiple services together, keeping dependencies and APIs in sync. |
| **Simplified Dev Workflow** | Single place to build, test, and deploy everything — reduces setup complexity. |
| **Better Visibility** | Teams can easily see changes across projects, improving collaboration and code quality. |
| **Atomic Changes** | You can make a change across multiple apps in a single commit (e.g., API change + client updates). |
| **Centralized Tooling** | Linting, formatting, testing — all standardized with one configuration. |
| **Scales Well** | With proper tools (like Bazel, Nx, Lerna), even huge repos stay fast and manageable. |

## Advantages of Monorepo



| **Aspect**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simplicity**     | Easy for developers to understand and modify as all components are bundled together.        |
| **Cost-Effectiveness** | More economical for startups and small to medium projects due to lower infrastructure needs. |
| **Performance**     | Offers better performance by reducing inter-component communication overhead.              |
| **Better Code Reuse**            | Common modules can be reused easily without duplication.                        |
| **Security**       | Fewer communication points reduce the attack surface, enhancing potential security.         |

## Disadvantages of Monorepo


| **Challenge**         | **Description**                                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Long Deployment Cycles** | Entire codebase must be deployed at once, causing longer deployment times.              |
| **Risk of Downtime**        | Full system may need to go offline during major updates, affecting users.               |
| **Limited Scalability**     | Scaling requires replicating the whole app, leading to inefficiency and high costs.     |
| **Resource Consumption**    | Monoliths consume more CPU and memory compared to lighter architectures.               |
| **Limited Flexibility**     | Changes are harder as they often impact multiple areas, increasing error risk.          |

## Best Practices for Monorepo Management

| **Best Practice**          | **Summary (One-liner)**                                                              |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clear Project Structure** | Organize code with well-defined directories for easy navigation and maintenance.    |
| **Consistent Coding Standards** | Enforce uniform style and linting rules across all projects.                   |
| **Efficient Dependency Management** | Use tools to isolate and manage dependencies cleanly.                  |
| **Incremental Builds**      | Implement builds that only recompile changed parts to save time.                   |
| **Strong CI/CD Pipelines**  | Automate testing, builds, and deployments to maintain code quality at scale.        |
| **Access Control**          | Restrict permissions carefully to protect sensitive areas of the codebase.          |
| **Effective Documentation** | Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation for onboarding and ongoing work.          |
| **Tooling for Scaling**     | Use specialized monorepo tools (e.g., Bazel, Nx, Turborepo) for performance.        |

## Conclusion
A monorepo offers significant benefits for large teams and organizations that rely on shared codebases and close collaboration between projects. By using best practices such as modularization, scalable tooling, and robust CI/CD pipelines, teams can manage the complexity of monorepos while benefiting from enhanced code reuse, visibility, and consistent deployment processes.
