## Overview
In this document, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the dependencies associated with the Employee API and elucidate their roles and functionalities. The Employee API is a critical component of our microservices architecture, designed to handle all employee-related transactions efficiently. By understanding the dependencies and their interactions, we can gain insight into the operational aspects of the Employee API, ensuring robust and seamless integration within the overall system.

**Tech Stack Used**

1. **ScyllaDB** – ScyllaDB as its primary database for robust data storage.

2. **Redis** – An in-memory key-value data store that helps with quick data access through caching.


## Purpose
The Employee REST API is a Golang-based microservice designed to handle all employee-related transactions within the OT-Microservices ecosystem. It is fully platform-independent, capable of running on any platform. 



### Architecture

#### Defination of Redis: 
"Redis (which stands for REmote DIctionary Server)is an open-source in-memory data structure store that also can be used as a database as well as caching. It supports almost all types of data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps. Redis also can be used for messaging systems used as pub/sub".  

#### Redis in Employee REST API
| Features | Description  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Caching**  | Temporarily stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the need for repeated database queries.|
| **Data Storage**| Acts as a high-speed, in-memory database for data accessed often but rarely changed.|
| **Session Management**| Manages user sessions and authentication tokens for quick accessibility and reduced database load.|
| **Performance Improvement**|Offloads read-heavy operations from ScyllaDB, improving overall system performance and scalability.|

   
  
 #### What is ScyllaDB:
ScyllaDB is a high-performance, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large volumes of data with low latency. It is compatible with Apache Cassandra but offers improved speed and efficiency due to its advanced architecture.

#### ScyllaDB in Employee REST API

| Features | Description  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Primary Database** | ScyllaDB serves as the primary database for storing employee-related data, such as profiles and transaction records. |
| **High Throughput** | Designed to handle high write and read throughput, making it suitable for managing large datasets efficiently. |
| **Low Latency** | Provides low-latency data access, ensuring quick response times for employee data retrieval and updates.|
|**Scalability**  | Offers horizontal scalability to accommodate growing amounts of data and increased load as the application scales.|



### Build-Dependencies
 - [Migrations](#what-is-migrations)
 - [Jq](#what-is-jq)
     
 #### What is Migrations:
 Migrations refer to the process of managing and applying changes to a database schema over time. This typically involves creating, 
 modifying, or deleting database tables and columns to accommodate evolving application requirements. Migrations ensure that database 
 structures are updated in a controlled and consistent manner.


#### **Migrations in Employee REST API**

| Features | Description  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| **Schema Evolution**  | Migrations help manage changes to the database schema, such as adding new tables or columns for additional employee information or updating existing ones.     |
| **Version Control** | Track and apply changes to the database schema in a version-controlled manner, ensuring that updates are applied consistently across different environments.             |
| **Data Integrity** |Ensure that schema changes do not disrupt existing data or application functionality, maintaining data integrity during updates.           |
|**Automated Updates** | OFacilitate automated application of schema changes, reducing manual intervention and minimizing the risk of errors.    |

  

#### What is Jq
Jq is a powerful command-line tool used for parsing, filtering, and manipulating JSON data. It allows users to perform complex operations on JSON structures with a simple and expressive syntax, making it an invaluable tool for working with JSON data in scripts and command-line interfaces.

#### Jq in Employee REST API
| Features | Description  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
|**JSON Parsing**|jq is used to parse JSON responses from the Employee API, extracting and processing specific data elements, such as employee records or API status messages|
|**Data Filtering**|Allows filtering of JSON data based on specific criteria, such as selecting employees based on their roles or statuses.|
|**Data Transformation**|Enables transformation of JSON data into different formats or structures for further processing or integration with other systems.|
|**Debugging and Testing**| Helps in debugging and testing API responses by allowing users to quickly inspect and validate JSON data returned by the Employee API.|



### Golang 
Go (Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed by Google, known for its simplicity, efficiency, and performance. It features built-in support for concurrency, making it ideal for building scalable and high-performance applications.

#### Golang in Employee REST API
| Features | Description  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
|**Microservice Architecture**|Go is employed to build the Employee REST API as a microservice, allowing it to handle employee-related transactions independently within the OT-Microservices ecosystem.|
|**Performance**|Go’s efficient execution and low-latency performance contribute to the API's ability to handle high volumes of requests and data with minimal delay.|
|**Concurrency**| Utilizes Go’s concurrency model (goroutines and channels) to manage multiple simultaneous API requests and background tasks efficiently.|
|**Scalability**|Leverages Go’s performance features to ensure that the API can scale effectively as the number of employees or transactions grows.|
|**Integration**|Facilitates easy integration with other services and databases, such as ScyllaDB and Redis, through Go’s robust standard library and third-party packages.|



### Swagger UI
Swagger UI is an open-source tool that provides a visual interface for interacting with and exploring RESTful APIs. It generates interactive documentation from OpenAPI specifications, enabling developers and users to easily understand, test, and validate API endpoints without needing to write code manually.

#### Swagger UI in Employee REST API
| Features | Description  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
|**API Documentation**|Automatically generates and displays interactive documentation for the Employee API, detailing available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.|
|**Interactive Testing**|Allows users and developers to test API endpoints directly from the browser interface, sending requests and viewing responses in real-time.|
|**Improved Usability**| Enhances the developer experience by providing a user-friendly interface for exploring and understanding the API’s functionality and behavior.|


#### Conclusion
The Employee REST API, built in Go, uses ScyllaDB for fast data storage, Redis for caching, jq for JSON handling, and Swagger UI for interactive documentation—ensuring scalable, high-performance employee data management within the OT-Microservices ecosystem.
