## Introduction

This documentation outlines the core concepts and practical value of GitOps tooling, emphasizing why GitOps emerged as a paradigm, what it brings to modern infrastructure and application lifecycle management, and how various tools align with the goals of automation, consistency, and declarative operations in cloud-native software development.

## Gitops Documentation
