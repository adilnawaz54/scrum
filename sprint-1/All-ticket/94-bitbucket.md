## Introduction
This document provides a structured way to evaluate and document the suitability of Bitbucket, a Git-based repository hosting and DevOps automation tool, for software development workflows.

---

## What?
**Bitbucket** is a tool that helps teams store, manage, and collaborate on their source code using Git. It is a web-based platform developed by Atlassian. Teams can create repositories, review each other’s code using pull requests, and automate testing and deployment through built-in CI/CD tools called Bitbucket Pipelines. Bitbucket works well with other Atlassian tools like Jira and Confluence.

---

## Why?
**Bitbucket** is being considered because it integrates deeply with Jira, which is already used by many teams in the organization. It also provides built-in CI/CD features (Bitbucket Pipelines), strong access controls, and supports both cloud and on-prem deployments — making it suitable for enterprise environments. Its private repository support, security features, and ease of use also make it a strong option for internal project collaboration.

## Pros and Cons

| Pros                                                        | Cons                                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

| Flexible access control and merge policies                  | Self-hosting requires infrastructure and licensing overhead |
| REST APIs and DevOps insights                               | Smaller open-source community                              |

---

## Conclusion

Bitbucket is a powerful, secure, and flexible tool for managing code repositories, especially suited for teams already using Jira and other Atlassian products. Its built-in CI/CD, security features, and integration capabilities make it a good fit for enterprise environments. However, for community/open-source focused teams, GitHub might offer better exposure and community collaboration.
