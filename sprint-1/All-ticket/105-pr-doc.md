## Introduction
This documentation is about Pull Request, which is widely used in open-source and enterprise environments to maintain clean, stable, and secure codebases. It allows teams to review, discuss, improve, and track modifications before integrating them.





## What is a Pull Request?

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="what is pull request" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9d9f59d-ec87-481b-a577-4c92034a2200">
</p>


A **Pull Request** is a formal request to "pull" your code into the main project, after review and approval. It allows developers to contribute to a project by suggesting modifications, which can be reviewed, discussed, and merged into the main codebase by the repository's maintainers. A pull request is an essential tool for collaborating on open-source projects or within teams.

## Why Do We Use Pull Requests

| Reason               | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Collaboration**    | Facilitates collaboration among multiple developers working on the same project.           |
| **Quality Assurance**| Ensures that changes are reviewed and meet the project's standards.                         |
| **Transparency**     | Keeps a detailed log of changes and the reasoning behind them.                               |
| **Feedback Loop**    | Encourages constructive feedback and helps improve code quality.                            |
| **Version Control**  | Provides control over the integration of changes into the main branch.                      |


## Features of Pull Requests

| Feature                | Description                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code Review**        | Pull requests allow team members or contributors to review code changes before they are merged. |
| **Discussion and Feedback** | Developers can discuss the proposed changes through comments and suggestions.                  |
| **Continuous Integration** | Automate testing and checks to ensure the proposed changes don't break the codebase.           |
| **Documentation**      | Provides a historical record of what changes were made, why, and by whom.                      |
| **Merge Control**      | Maintainers control when and how code changes are merged into the main branch.                 |

## Architecture

<p align="center">
   <img width="600" alt="How to use pull request" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b983b4f9-4c87-4bc3-8679-2cd3a0a50dac">

### Advantages of Pull Requests

| Benefit                             | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Promotes Team Collaboration**     | Encourages multiple team members to review, suggest changes, and collaborate effectively.|
| **Improves Code Quality**           | By allowing multiple people to review the changes, potential bugs or improvements can be identified. |
| **Tracks Changes**                  | Helps maintain a record of what changes were made and why.  |
| **Enforces Best Practices**         | Pull requests can be set up to enforce guidelines and best practices before merging code.  |

### Disadvantages of Pull Requests

| Disadvantage | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| **Slower Development Cycle** | Waiting for reviews and approvals can delay merging and releasing new features. |
| **Review Bottlenecks** | If reviewers are busy or unavailable, PRs can pile up, creating a backlog. |
| **Overhead for Small Changes** | Even simple fixes (like typo corrections) require formal review, adding unnecessary process overhead. |
| **Merge Conflicts** | Long-living PRs can easily get outdated, leading to complex merge conflicts that are harder to resolve. |

## **JIRA** and **Pull Request (PR) mechanisms**


### Step 1: **JIRA Issue Creation**

* A developer (or product owner) creates a **JIRA issue** (e.g., `PROJECT-123`) for a new feature, bugfix, or task.
* This issue will act as the anchor for code changes.

---

### Step 2: **Branch Creation Linked to JIRA**

* The developer creates a **Git branch** with the JIRA issue key in the name, for example:
  `SCRUMS-106-Adil`

---

### Step 3: **Code Development & Commit Messages**
* These commits will also be **linked to the JIRA issue automatically**.

---

### Step 4: **Create a Pull Request**

* A PR is raised from the feature branch (e.g., `SCRUMS-106-Adil`) to the main/development branch.
* If the PR title or description includes the JIRA issue key, **JIRA will automatically link this PR** under the issue's "Development" section.

---

### Step 5: **PR Appears in JIRA**

  * JIRA shows the PR status (`Open`, `Merged`, `Declined`)
  * Reviewer(s) can see the PR directly in JIRA.

## Best Practices for Pull Requests

| Best Practice | Description |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **Keep Pull Requests Small** | Focus on a single logical change to make reviews faster and easier to understand. |
| **Write Clear Titles and Descriptions** | Summarize *what* the change does and *why* itâ€™s needed to help reviewers quickly grasp the purpose. |
| **Request Specific Reviewers** | Assign reviewers who have the right context or ownership of the code being modified. |
| **Link with Tickets** | Connect the PR to related issues (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) for full traceability. |
| **Address Review Comments Thoughtfully** | Engage respectfully with reviewer feedback; explain if you disagree instead of ignoring. |


---



### Conclusion

* Pull Requests (PRs) help manage contributions to a repository in a structured way.
* They maintain high-quality, stable, and secure codebases through code reviews.
* They support smooth and safe integration of code into the main branch.
* Small and focused PRs help in catching bugs early during the review process.
