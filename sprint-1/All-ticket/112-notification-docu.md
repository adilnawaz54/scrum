## Introduction

In any development workflow, it's important to stay informed about code changes, system events, and team activities. This guide introduces a notification system that integrates with your version control platform (like GitHub or GitLab) to help you monitor project updates in real time. You'll learn how to set it up, configure it to match your needs, and follow best practices for effective communication.

## Purpose

The purpose of this guide is to provide a clear and actionable approach to setting up a version control notification system. It is meant to help teams:
- Automatically receive updates about repository activity (e.g., pull requests, issues, CI/CD events).
- Minimize delays in communication or missed changes.
- Maintain team awareness and accountability through structured notifications.

## Pre-requisites

Before setting up VCS notifications, make sure you have the following:

| **Requirement**                    | **Description**                                                                                               |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VCS Account**                    | A valid account on a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).                                |
| **Repository Access**              | Admin or maintain-level access to manage repository settings and configure integrations.                      |
| **Defined Notification Goals**     | Clear understanding of what types of updates or alerts you want to receive (e.g., PR activity, CI failures).  |
| **Email or Messaging Platform**    | A working email address or team messaging tool (e.g., Gmail, Slack, Microsoft Teams) for receiving updates.   |

## Best Practices

| **Practice**                   | **Description**                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Enable Relevant Notifications** | Activate only the notifications that apply to your role or responsibilities to reduce noise and stay focused.    |
| **Separate Channels by Type**    | Use different emails or tools (e.g., Slack, Gmail) for different types of updates—like system alerts vs. code reviews. |
| **Review Settings Regularly**   | Periodically check and adjust your notification preferences as your team or project needs evolve.               |
| **Team-wide Configuration**     | Ensure all teammates configure notifications properly to avoid missed updates and maintain smooth collaboration. |


## Conclusion

Setting up notifications in your version control system (VCS) is a simple but powerful way to stay on top of important updates. With the right configuration and practices, your team can stay informed, respond quickly to issues, and collaborate more effectively. Use this guide as a reference to keep your project communication clear and timely.
