# **Purpose**

The purpose of branching strategies help keep the code stable and make teamwork easier by organizing how developers create, merge, and manage different changes. It allows multiple tasks to happen at the same time and ensures smooth releases

# **Introduction**

Branching strategies help organize code updates in Git. This guide covers four types .
- Feature Branch Flow
- Git Flow,
- GitLab Flow, and
- Environment Branch Flow

# **Types of Branching Strategies**


# **Feature Branch Flow**

Feature Branch Flow is a straightforward and effective strategy where each new feature is developed in a dedicated branch. This approach ensures isolated development, making it easier to manage changes, conduct code reviews, and avoid disruptions to the main codebase.

### Key Features:
- Short-lived branches dedicated to a single feature.
- Ideal for small teams or projects with simple development needs.
- Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into the main branch.

For more information, refer to the [Feature Branch Flow Documentation](https://github.com/snaatak-Downtime-Crew/Documentation/blob/SCRUMS-100-Nishkarsh/vcs_design%20%2B%20poc/branching%20strategy/feature%20branch%20flow/README.md).


# **Git Flow**

Git Flow is a well-defined branching strategy that introduces multiple branches for feature development, releases, and hotfixes. This strategy is ideal for projects with a structured release cycle, helping manage development phases more effectively.

### Key Features:
- Long-lived branches such as master, develop, and release.
- Feature branches for new features and hotfix branches for critical fixes.
- Clear separation between development, testing, and production-ready code.

For more details, refer to the [Git Flow Documentation]().

# **GitLab Flow**

GitLab Flow combines elements from both Feature Branch Flow and Git Flow, with a focus on deployment environments. It emphasizes continuous integration and deployment, making it a great choice for modern DevOps workflows.

### Key Features:
- Integrates environment branches (e.g., production, staging) with feature branches.
- Simplifies the merge and deployment processes.
- Supports CI/CD pipelines for streamlined automation.

For more details, refer to the [GitLab Flow Documentation](https://github.com/snaatak-Downtime-Crew/Documentation/tree/SCRUMS-102-PRINCE/vcs_design%20%2B%20poc/branching%20strategy/gitlab%20flow).


# **Environment Branch Flow**

Environment Branch Flow involves using long-lived branches to represent different deployment environments such as development, staging, and production. This strategy enhances visibility into what code is deployed where and facilitates smooth promotion of code across environments.

### Key Features:
- Long-lived branches represent distinct environments.
- Code promotion flows from less stable to more stable environments.
- Supports complex deployment scenarios with multiple testing or staging environments.

For more details, refer to the [Environment Branch Flow Documentation](https://github.com/snaatak-Downtime-Crew/Documentation/tree/SCRUMS-103-SHIVANI/vcs_design%20%2B%20poc/branching%20strategy/environment%20branch%20flow).



# **How to Choose a Branching Strategy**

| Factor              | Recommendation                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Team Size**       | Small teams → Feature Branch Flow<br>Large teams → Git Flow                    |
| **Project Complexity** | Complex projects → Git Flow or Environment Branch Flow                         |
| **Release Frequency** | Continuous deployment → GitLab Flow or Environment Branch Flow                 |
| **Deployment Needs**  | Need clear environment visibility → Environment Branch Flow                    |



# **Comparison of Branching Strategies**

| Feature                     | Feature Branch Flow | Git Flow      | GitLab Flow      | Environment Branch Flow |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Complexity**              | Low                 | High          | Medium           | Medium                  |
| **Best For**                | Small projects      | Formal releases | CI/CD           | Multi-environment setups |
| **Release Cycle**           | Ad hoc              | Scheduled     | Continuous       | Environment-based       |
| **Branch Lifespan**         | Short-lived         | Long-lived    | Mixed            | Long-lived              |
| **Hotfix Management**       | Direct to main      | Hotfix branch | Direct to main   | Separate hotfix branch  |
| **Deployment Control**      | Low                 | Medium        | High             | Very High               |


# **Conclusion**

For this project, we are using the Feature Branch Flow, where each new feature is developed in a dedicated branch. This approach keeps development isolated, making it easier to manage changes, conduct code reviews, and ensure a stable main branch. Once a feature is complete, it is merged back into the main branch.
