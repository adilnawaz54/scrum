## Introduction

This document provides a structured evaluation of GitLab, a web-based DevOps lifecycle tool that provides a Git repository manager with features such as issue tracking, CI/CD pipeline support, and more. The objective is to assess its suitability as a Version Control System (VCS) and DevOps platform.

---

## What is This Tool?

GitLab is a single application for the entire software development and DevOps lifecycle. It enables teams to collaborate on code, build CI/CD pipelines, monitor deployments, and manage project lifecycles efficiently. GitLab combines version control, issue tracking, code review, CI/CD, and application security features into a single platform.
