## Introduction

A **monorepo** is a single Git repository that houses code for **multiple projects or services**. It enables shared code, unified tooling, and easier collaboration across teams, even if the services are developed and deployed independently.


## What is Monorepo?
A **Monorepo** (short for Monolithic Repository) is a software development strategy where all the code for multiple projects, services, or libraries is stored in a single shared repository.

## Why to use Mono repo?

| **Benefit**                          | **Description**                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simplified Dependency Management** | Shared libraries are reused easily without complex versioning.                  |
| **Atomic Changes**                   | Multiple projects can be updated in a single commit, ensuring consistency.      |
| **Better Collaboration**             | Teams can work across services without switching between multiple repositories. |
| **Improved Visibility**              | System-wide changes are visible to everyone, reducing duplication and silos.    |


## Features

| Feature | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| **Unified Versioning** | You can update multiple services together, keeping dependencies and APIs in sync. |
| **Simplified Dev Workflow** | Single place to build, test, and deploy everything — reduces setup complexity. |
| **Atomic Changes** | You can make a change across multiple apps in a single commit (e.g., API change + client updates). |
| **Centralized Tooling** | Linting, formatting, testing — all standardized with one configuration. |

---

## Architecture
This architecture manages multiple logically independent projects within one repository for centralized versioning, consistency, and collaboration.

## Advantages of Monorepo



| **Aspect**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simplicity**     | Easy for developers to understand and modify as all components are bundled together.        |
| **Performance**     | Offers better performance by reducing inter-component communication overhead.              |
| **Better Code Reuse**            | Common modules can be reused easily without duplication.                        |
| **Security**       | Fewer communication points reduce the attack surface, enhancing potential security.         |

## Disadvantages of Monorepo


| **Challenge**         | **Description**                                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Long Deployment Cycles** | Entire codebase must be deployed at once, causing longer deployment times.              |
| **Risk of Downtime**        | Full system may need to go offline during major updates, affecting users.               |
| **Limited Scalability**     | Scaling requires replicating the whole app, leading to inefficiency and high costs.     |
| **Resource Consumption**    | Monoliths consume more CPU and memory compared to lighter architectures.               |
| **Limited Flexibility**     | Changes are harder as they often impact multiple areas, increasing error risk.          |

## Best Practices for Monorepo Management

| **Best Practice**          | **Summary (One-liner)**                                                              |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clear Project Structure** | Organize code with well-defined directories for easy navigation and maintenance.    |
| **Consistent Coding Standards** | Enforce uniform style and linting rules across all projects.                   |
| **Efficient Dependency Management** | Use tools to isolate and manage dependencies cleanly.                  |
| **Incremental Builds**      | Implement builds that only recompile changed parts to save time.                   |
| **Strong CI/CD Pipelines**  | Automate testing, builds, and deployments to maintain code quality at scale.        |
| **Access Control**          | Restrict permissions carefully to protect sensitive areas of the codebase.          |
| **Effective Documentation** | Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation for onboarding and ongoing work.          |

## Conclusion
A monorepo offers significant benefits for large teams and organizations that rely on shared codebases and close collaboration between projects. By using best practices such as modularization, scalable tooling, and robust CI/CD pipelines, teams can manage the complexity of monorepos while benefiting from enhanced code reuse, visibility, and consistent deployment processes.
