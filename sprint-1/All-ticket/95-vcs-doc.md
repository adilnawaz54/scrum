# **Why we need VCS**
We use a Version Control System (VCS) like Git to manage code changes, collaborate with multiple developers, and keep our project organized. It allows safe updates, easy rollback, better code reviews, and smooth integration with CI/CD tools for automated testing and deployment. Overall, VCS improves teamwork, speeds up development, and ensures code quality.
