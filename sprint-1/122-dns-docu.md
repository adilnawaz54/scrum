## Introduction
> The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet’s phone book. It helps you find websites by translating easy-to-remember names (like www.example.com) into the numerical IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to locate each other on the internet. Without DNS, you would have to remember long strings of numbers to visit your favorite websites. 

## Why DNS

> Without DNS, we’d have to remember long numbers (IP addresses) for every website, which would be hard and confusing. DNS makes the internet easy to use by letting us type website names instead of numbers.

## What is DNS 
> The Domain Name System (DNS) works like the internet's phonebook. When you type a web address like "google.com" or "nytimes.com" into a browser, DNS helps find the right IP address for that website. The browser then uses this IP address to connect to the website's server and load the page. DNS servers are the computers that respond to these requests, helping browsers find the right websites quickly.

## Types of records

 - **A (Address) Record:** Maps a domain name to an IPv4 address.

 - **AAAA (IPv6 Address) Record:** Maps a domain name to an IPv6 address

 - **CNAME (Canonical Name) Record:** Maps a domain name (alias) to another domain name.

 - **MX (Mail Exchange) Record:** Directs email to mail servers for a domain.

 - **TXT (Text) Record:** Provides arbitrary text data for a domain. 

 - **SOA (Start of Authority) Record:** Contains administrative information about the domain.

### DNS Recursor (or Resolver): 
> This is like a "helper" that looks up the website address for you. When you want to visit a website, it asks other servers to find the correct IP address that leads to the website.
### Root Nameservers: 
> These are the starting points of the DNS system. They help by pointing the resolver to the right type of server based on the website’s domain (like ".com", ".org", etc.).
### TLD Nameservers :
> These servers manage the domain extensions like ".com", ".org", and so on. They tell the resolver where to find the next server that knows the website’s exact IP address.
### Authoritative Nameservers:
> These are the "final answer" servers. They have the exact IP address for the website you're looking for. There are two types:

    Master (Primary): The main server that holds the original IP records.
    Slave (Secondary): A backup server that has a copy of the information in case the master server fails.
