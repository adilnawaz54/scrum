## Introduction 
* This document will guide you through a Proof of Concept (PoC) for setting up and compiling . We will cover the necessary prerequisites, dependency as well as the basic project structure.

##  Pre-Requisites

- Go installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with Go modules.

##  System Requirements
| Hardware Specifications | Minimum Requirement  |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Processor                | dual-core              |
| RAM                      | 4 GB                    |
| Disk                     |10 GB free disk space                  |
| OS                       | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS         |


##  Build-Time Dependency

|  Name |  Version |  Description |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| **Go modules** | 1.20      | Make sure your Go project uses Go modules (go.mod and go.sum) for dependency management. |


##  Run-Time Dependency

|  Name |  Version |  Description          |
|---------|------------|--------------------------|
| **ScyllaDB** |  6.1.1  | ScyllaDB is a NoSQL database being utilized as the primary database in the employee application |

##  Important Ports

| ðŸ”Œ Inbound Traffic | ðŸ“„ Description           |
|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **9042**           | Used by ScyllaDB |

 
##  Step-by-step Installation
###  Step 1: Check the Go version
```
go version
```
###  Step 2: If not installed, install Go

### Step 5: Code Compilation
This command compiles the source code of the project according to the settings defined in the main.go file.
- **go build:** This command compiles the Go source code in the current directory and produces an executable binary.
If successful, it will create a binary file named employee-api.

- **./employee-api:** This command executes the binary that was created by the go build command.
The ./ indicates that the binary is located in the current directory.
Running this command starts the employee API service, making it ready to handle requests.

```
./employee-api
```

- Compilation Successful: The Go source code has been successfully compiled into an executable binary named employee-api. The service is now ready to be executed and handle incoming requests.
