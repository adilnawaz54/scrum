## Introduction
Go, also known as Golang, is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency. This document provides an overview of code compilation in Go, highlighting tools, benefits, and best practices.

## What is Code Compilation?
Code compilation is the process of converting source code written in a programming language into executable machine code. This process involves the Go compiler (`go build`), which generates binaries that can be executed on various platforms.

## Why Compile Go Code?
| **Aspect**        | **Description**                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**   | Compiled binaries run faster than interpreted code.        |
| **Deployment**    | Compiled code is easier to distribute and deploy.          |
| **Static Typing** | Helps catch errors at compile time, enhancing reliability. |

| **Go Compiler (`go build`)** | The default Go toolchain for compiling source code into native binaries.                                        | Standard compilation for development and production.              |
| **Gccgo**                    | An alternative Go compiler based on the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).                                          | For integrating Go with GCC toolchains or advanced optimizations. |
| **Cross-Compilation**        | Built-in feature of the Go compiler that allows targeting different OS/architectures using `GOOS` and `GOARCH`. | Building binaries for platforms other than the development host.  |
| **TinyGo**                   | A lightweight Go compiler for microcontrollers and WebAssembly.                                                 | Ideal for IoT, embedded systems, and WASM applications.           |

## Advantages of Go Code Compilation
| **Aspect**   | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Speed**    | Compiled code generally executes faster than interpreted languages.             |
| **Safety**   | Errors are caught during compilation, reducing runtime failures.                |
| **Simplicity** | The Go toolchain is straightforward, making it easy to compile projects.      |


## **Proof Of Concept (POC)**
> **NOTE:**   
> We are using **Employee-API** for Code Compilation in GoLang.  
> Refer to the official POC documentation for complete steps: [Code Compilation POC](https://github.com/snaatak-Downtime-Crew/Documentation/tree/SCRUMS-157-Vardaan/application-ci/checks/java/static-code-analysis/poc) 




## Best Practices
| Practice                  | Description                                                                                      |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Go Modules**       | Always use modules for dependency management. This allows for versioning and better isolation.  |
| **Organize Code**        | Follow Go's conventions for project structure: place code in `pkg`, `cmd`, `internal`, etc.     |
| **Cross-Compile as Needed** | Utilize cross-compilation to build binaries for different platforms (e.g., Linux, Windows).     |
| **Automate Builds**      | Use CI/CD pipelines (like GitHub Actions) to automate the compilation process.     |

## Conclusion**

We chose the **Go Compiler** as our primary build tool because it is fast, reliable, and well-integrated into the Go ecosystem. It supports module-based dependency management, flexible build flags, and seamless CI/CD integration. By following best practices like using Go modules and automating builds, we ensure consistent, high-performance application delivery across environments.
