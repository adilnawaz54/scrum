###  Introduction

Continuous Integration (CI) orchestration tools help automate the process of building, testing, and integrating code changes in a consistent and scalable way. These tools are essential for modern DevOps practices, ensuring quick feedback and reliable software delivery pipelines.

###  What is CI Orchestration?

CI orchestration refers to the automated coordination and execution of various steps involved in the CI pipeline—such as code compilation, testing, and deployment—using a centralized tool. The orchestrator manages dependencies, executes jobs in sequence or parallel, and handles infrastructure integrations.
